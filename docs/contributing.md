## Contribution Ideas

- More common PHP deployment tasks.
- Method to roll back MySQL migrations?
- Empty out ~/private/deployments/ansible/.ansible/tmp/ when finished.
- Change how config files with 'secrets' are handled. Encrypt with ansible-vault and store in Git repo. Then decrypt on deploy.
- Put the roll back tasks into a proper Role, like the deploy tasks are.
